# XDM1041-Python
A python driver for the XDM1041 Multimeter instrument

The XDM1041 is a capable, "lower cost" benchtop DMM (~$150 USD)

One reviewer compared it to a $1000 Fluke instrument with very good results.

One of the key features is high precision DC voltage measurement at 50mV range. 
There is also a fine-grained 500uA current measurement range for AC and DC. 

The meter can be controlled via RS232 port and the readings can be sent over the port.
